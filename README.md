I have a swifter H-1960 model and it fell off the hook on the wall and broke the green connector piece. I couldn't find a part that had broken off that holds the head in so I looked around online. No luck, I did find one that adapts it to a painters handle and figured I could modify that to work for what I needed. If you follow the github link I have it posted with the fusion360 files if you want to modify it yourself. Hope this helps someone else out in cyberspace.

@fuferman_44333 on Printables made the connector piece. I modified it and made it so it works with the swifter again. [Orginal File Here](https://www.printables.com/model/272122-swiffer-broomstick-paint-pole-adapter)
